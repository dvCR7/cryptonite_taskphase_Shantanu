# Comprehending Commands
## Cat: Not The Pet, But The Command!
Learnt what the `cat` command does.<br>
It reads the content of the file given.<br>
If provided with multiple arguments it will read all of them. <br>
Both Absolute and Relative paths can be passed as arguments.<br>
Used `cat flag` to get the flag.<br>
```bash
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{AeVcBqpXa9hHi7xRNzJXqviQ6d5.dFzN1QDLzYTN0czW}
```
## Catting Absolute Paths
As mentioned above absolute paths can be passed as arguments to `cat` command.<br>
so it was given in the challenge that flag was not directly in home so used `cat /flag` to get it.<br>
```bash
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{AvQKF8iHma2EB9MVFUadqKOZI2b.dlTM5QDLzYTN0czW}
```
## More Catting Practice
In this challenge I wasn't allowed to use cd to get to flag directly.<br>
Rather than that I had to use the whole absolute path as an argument to the cat command.<br>
As I was lost and didn't know where flag was so i used cd(which was prohibited).<br>
The terminal then gave me the exact path so i used the `cat` command to access it.<br>
command - `cat /opt/radare2/sys/flag` to get the flag.<br>
```bash
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /opt/radare2/sys/flag
pwn.college{wq6D2GrJM13Z52vcHyGuZkqx4YL.dBjM5QDLzYTN0czW}
```
## Grepping For A Needle In A Haystack
Learnt to use the `grep` command and how It can be used to traverse the whole content of a file and provide us with a line that has that string. <br>
`grep a b` has two arguments where a = string to be searched and b = the absolute path of that file.txt in which it is to be searched.<br>
```bash
hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
pwn.college{UBTYryae5dxPMecOJUIxzLWTwcm.ddTM4QDLzYTN0czW}
```
## Comparing Files
diff command - 'diff' compares two files line by line and shows you exactly what's different between them.
```bash
hacker@commands~comparing-files:~$ diff /challenge/decoys_only.txt /challenge/decoys_and_real.txt 
45a46
> pwn.college{M85w2k0yLNFy_oRcvjMPFe128s9.01MwMDOxwCO2UDOzEzW}
```
## Listing Files
Learnt about the `ls` command and how it can be used to know the contents of a directory.<br>
In this challenge the file run was renamed so i used `ls /challenge` to know the name of the renamed file.<br>
Then used `/challenge/renamed` to run it to get the flag.<br>
```bash
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ ls /challenge
32613-renamed-run-28805  DESCRIPTION.md
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ /challenge/32613-renamed-run-28805
Yahaha, you found me! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{c859Ym-hvggMM4HAd8gfcciCQ9b.dhjM4QDLzYTN0czW}
```
## Touching Files
This was fairly simple. I had to create two files in the `tmp` directory by using the `touch` command.<br>
After that used `/challenge/run` to get the flag.<br>
```bash
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ cd /tmp
hacker@commands~touching-files:/tmp$ touch pwn
hacker@commands~touching-files:/tmp$ touch college
hacker@commands~touching-files:/tmp$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UQ_S2lVvuqpumAebylYJpm4kfLb.dBzM4QDLzYTN0czW}
```
## Removing Files
In this I learnt about rm command and how it is used to delete files from a directory.<br>
After I Deleted the file using `rm delete_me` then used `/challenege/check` to get the flag.<br>
```bash
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ ls
delete_me  h
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ rm delete_me
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ /challenge/check
Excellent removal. Here is your reward:
pwn.college{AnDWP57Iysy1LnxTgCZ4Ew77Kav.dZTOwUDLzYTN0czW}
```
## Hidden Files
Learnt that not all files are visible when `ls` is used and files that are preceded by `.` are hidden. <br>
To view the hidden files i used the `ls -a` command.<br>
There was a sus file named `.flag---`.<br>
I tried to run it by `/.flag--`but it showed access denied.<br>
So i used the `cat` command to read the flag out of it.<br>
```bash
hacker@commands~hidden-files:~$ cd /
hacker@commands~hidden-files:/$ ls -a
.                      bin        etc    lib64   nix   run   tmp
..                     boot       home   libx32  opt   sbin  usr
.dockerenv             challenge  lib    media   proc  srv   var
.flag-210942113927702  dev        lib32  mnt     root  sys
hacker@commands~hidden-files:/$ cat .flag-210942113927702
pwn.college{MmRY9oXc3rD-lackXvYw2ec-bDT.dBTN4QDLzYTN0czW}
```
## An Epic Filesystem Quest
In this we had to show our proficiency in using `cat`,`ls` and `cd` commands.<br>
There were some conditions to be met otherwise the files would self destruct but it was fairly easy.<br>
Files were hidden, some had conditions to only access from directory or some had not going in the directoy.<br>
Finally After a series of `cd` `cat` and `ls` i was finally able to get the flag.<br>
```bash
hacker@commands~an-epic-filesystem-quest:~$ cd /
hacker@commands~an-epic-filesystem-quest:/$ ls -a
.           SPOILER  challenge  flag  lib32   media  opt   run   sys  var
..          bin      dev        home  lib64   mnt    proc  sbin  tmp
.dockerenv  boot     etc        lib   libx32  nix    root  srv   usr
hacker@commands~an-epic-filesystem-quest:/$ cat SPOILER
Yahaha, you found me!
The next clue is in: /opt/linux/linux-5.4/drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5

The next clue is **hidden** --- its filename starts with a '.' character. You'll need to look for it using special options to 'ls'.

Tubular find!
The next clue is in: /opt/linux/linux-5.4/arch/csky/boot

Watch out! The next clue is **trapped**. You'll need to read it out without 'cd'ing into the directory; otherwise, the clue will self destruct!

hacker@commands~an-epic-filesystem-quest:~$ cat /opt/linux/linux-5.4/arch/csky/boot/LEAD-TRAPPED
Great sleuthing!
The next clue is in: /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/scipy/optimize/_shgo_lib

## Making Directories
In this I learnt how to use the `mkdir` command and make a directory named `pwn` in tmp directory.<br>
Then I used `touch` to create a file named `college`.<br>
Then used `/challenge/run` to get the flag.<br>
```bash
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ cd /tmp
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp$ ls
bin  hsperfdata_root  tmp.MiOQGWw5Zc
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp$ mkdir pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp$ cd pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ touch college
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ ls
college
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{snB8XU63Z2y_K2aym4UzZBR9kDg.dFzM4QDLzYTN0czW}
```
## Finding Files
In this I learnt about the `find` command.<br>
How versatile it can be. We could find by name or directory on the whole system.<br>
When I used `find` command I got multiple directories and files named `flag` I ran them one by one and got the flag in the third file.<br> 
```bash
hacker@commands~finding-files:~$ cd /

## Linking Files
`ln -s originalpath linkpath`
In this i learnt what linking is and how It can be performed.<br>
There are two types of links Hard Link and Soft Link.<br>
Hard Link basically creates a copy of the target file while on the other hand Soft link just has the address of the target files and refers the terminal to that address.<br>
Rest of the task was fairly simple, just had to retrieve the flag from the target file.<br>
```bash
hacker@commands~linking-files:~$ cd /
hacker@commands~linking-files:/$ ls
bin   challenge  etc   home  lib32  libx32  mnt  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr
boot  dev        flag  lib   lib64  media   nix  proc  run   srv   tmp  var
hacker@commands~linking-files:/$ ln -s /flag /home/hacker/not-the-flag
hacker@commands~linking-files:/$ /challenge/catflag
About to read out the /home/hacker/not-the-flag file!
pwn.college{UF54v0gikO8ybslmck9-D_9goyW.dlTM1UDLzYTN0czW}
